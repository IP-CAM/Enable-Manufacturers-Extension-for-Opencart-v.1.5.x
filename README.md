# Enable / Disable Multiple Manufacturers 
Extension for OpenCart 1.5.x

**What:** adds multi-category "Enable" and "Disable" button functionality to Manufacturer List on Admin Dashboard.  Clears cache on update so results show up instantly on website front-end.

**Where:** two new buttons, "Enable" and "Disable" are added next to the default "Insert" and "Delete".

**How:** works differently than currently existing available ajax extensions, which only allow a change of the category status by clicking a single product at a time. Makes use of the checkboxes to select multiple categories (or all) and executes upon clicking the appropriate new button.

**More:** displays a success message indicating the number of manufacturers enabled/disabled and updates the system cache so that changes take effect instantly on the website front-end

Requirements: OpenCart v1.5.x with vQmod installed
